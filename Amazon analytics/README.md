# Amazon Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Amazon sales data using various data science techniques and tools. The goal is to perform ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) on the dataset, identify sales trends, and uncover meaningful relationships between different attributes within the data. The analysis is expected to provide insights into month-wise, year-wise, and yearly-month-wise sales trends.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Tableau/Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and visual representations of the data.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visual representation of the dataset.

## Problem Statement

Sales management is crucial in today's competitive business environment, especially in e-commerce. Effective sales management can reduce costs and increase profits. This project aims to analyze Amazon sales data to identify key metrics and trends that can help improve sales strategies.

### Objectives:
1. **Sales Trend Analysis**:
   - Month-wise
   - Year-wise
   - Yearly-month-wise
2. **Key Metrics Identification**:
   - Determine significant factors impacting sales.
   - Explore relationships between various attributes.
