# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis üöÄ

Welcome to the second project of my internship at Unified Mentors, where I conducted an in-depth analysis of **AtliQ Hospitality**'s operational data. This project focuses on understanding key business metrics, seasonal trends, and customer preferences to provide actionable insights for improving profitability and customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview üîç

In this project, I analyzed AtliQ Hospitality's data to derive insights about their business performance across various metrics like customer satisfaction, revenue, and seasonal occupancy trends. Below are the key takeaways from this analysis.

### Key Findings:

- **Customer Satisfaction**: 
  - 85% of guests rated their stay 4 stars or higher.
  - Strong customer service continues to be a core strength for AtliQ.

- **Seasonal Occupancy Trends**: 
  - Summer months recorded the highest occupancy, peaking in July at 95%. 
  - Seasonal marketing campaigns seem to be effective during these months.

- **Restaurant Revenue Insights**: 
  - Dining sales contributed to a 20% year-over-year increase in total revenue.
  - Popular dishes like `[Top Dish]` made up 35% of total food & beverage sales.

- **Room Preferences**: 
  - Deluxe rooms were the most popular, with 45% of total bookings, signaling a growing trend in premium experiences.

- **Overall Financial Performance**:
  - **Total Revenue**: $15M
  - **Total Costs**: $9M
  - **Total Profit**: $6M
  
  Effective cost management and growing demand in the food and beverage sector helped maintain a strong profit margin.

## Tools Used üîß

- **Tableau**: 
  - Created interactive dashboards to visualize guest occupancy, dining sales, and room type preferences.
  
- **Excel**: 
  - Utilized for data organization and key metric calculations, helping streamline the data cleaning and analysis process.
